## About Me
![Profile Picture](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering at USF, specializing in multiobjective optimization, network optimization, optimization under uncertainty, advanced data analytics, and applied deep reinforcement learning with applications to environment and social sustainability, sustainable supply chain and circular economy, waste management systems, manufacturing and service operations management. 
My research focused on developing innovative methods, algorithms, and frameworks to solve complex problems, such as watershed nutrient management for harmful alage blooms (Funded by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), sustainable supply chain and circular economy, fair and equity based crowd shipping and last mile delivery solutions, real time decision making in production, warehousing and logistics management optimization, with publications in top-tier journals. As the former president of the INFORMS student chapter (2023-24), I led initiatives like the international Data Science Bootcamp, earning the Summa Cum Laude Best Student Chapter Award at INFORMS 2024. I am passionate about advancing technology, innovation, and management through data-driven insights.
